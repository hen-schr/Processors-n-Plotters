## Summary

This repository contains various smaller scripts that can be used to process and plot data from various origins. The scripts are intended to be standalone with little dependencies. Thus, infrastructure such as file readers or data converters can be found in multiple scripts. The basic structure and functionality is intended to be fairly simple, allowing users with little python experience to use the scripts - or being easily customizable by more experienced users.
